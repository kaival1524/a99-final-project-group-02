# Plan (Documents meetings details and project layout)

## **Meeting 1 (11/28)** 

Held a meeting regarding the planning of what our web application should accomplish and how it should be designed/laid out. The details are listed below.

**Project Layout Details**

The goal of this project is to create a web application which helps users track their daily fitness activities and goals. The web application will have a
login page which allows users to register an account or login if an account is already registered. Additionally, when the users are logged in, they will 
have the option to add fitness activity for the day which is measured by exercise time, workout description, and future goals. The user will also have the option
to see previous fitness details on specific dates as well as goals that they have set for themselves. The user will also be able to unregister themselves. The
databases that will be used are the interaction database (for tracking user interactions), user database (for tracking all registered users), and the data storage (
for having all user information).
